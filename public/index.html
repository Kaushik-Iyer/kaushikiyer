                                    <p>This was a personal project on which I worked at during summer 2024. Since a long time I had been wanting to develop a proper project from scratch which was not a youtube tutorial or a walkthrough. All of the ideas for this project were things that I wanted to implement. The whole backend and frontend has been done by myself, and since I like working on backend more, unfortunately the frontend aesthetics and accessibility are not upto the mark. Anyway, the frontend is in React, and backend built in python&rsquo;s FASTAPI. The scores are regularly updated from a third party API through websockets, the nearby grounds are fetched by using the user&rsquo;s location and Google Places API. The website also performs Google OAuth 2.0 through the frontend itself. A large part of the project also involved figuring out the hosting aspects, including getting a domain, and hosting the frontend as well as the backend folders. I eventually got a domain free for a year through name.com, hosted the frontend through cloudflare pages in their free tier, and got to host the backend in heroku for 2 years through Github&rsquo;s Student Developer Pack.</p>

                                    <p>Built this group project as part of Cornell&rsquo;s Applications of Parallel Computers course (CS 5220), where we tackled the classic Traveling Salesman Problem using various optimization techniques. The goal was to push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible with parallel computing.</p>
<p>We implemented four different approaches - from exact solutions using Brute Force and Dynamic Programming to heuristic methods like Greedy and Genetic algorithms. The real challenge was optimizing these for parallel execution using OpenMP and CUDA.</p>
<p>The results were pretty exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got a 20x speedup using OpenMP for the Dynamic Programming solution</li>
<li>Achieved 8x improvement with CUDA implementation</li>
<li>Scaled our CUDA-optimized greedy algorithm to handle millions of cities</li>
</ul>
<p>The project really showcases how parallel computing can transform traditionally complex problems. We built a comprehensive testing framework to make sure our optimizations didn&rsquo;t sacrifice accuracy for speed.</p>
<p>This was a great deep dive into high-performance computing, showing how theoretical concepts can be applied to solve real-world optimization challenges. I also attempted to solve the World TSP dataset using the CUDA version of the greedy algorithm implementation.</p>

This project aims to solve some of the shortcomings of existing greentech technologies such as lack of verifiability and difficulty in tracking orders by leveraging the strengths of blockchain technology and its features of immutability, verifiability, and transparency.</p>
<p>And since this was a part of an academic research paper as well, extensive efforts were put into performance testing of the platform, which included performing load testing under multiple simultaneous users calling computationally intensive functionalities such as create project, and upload images. These tests were performed under different request body sizes and multiple such calls. The test suites and visualizations were custom developed in Python, primarily using modules such as asyncio, locust, and matplotlib for concurrency, load test configurations, and visualizations respectively. These were custom made because Postman&rsquo;s collection run functionality did not cater to this particular use case.</p>

<ul>
<li>Started with implementing an exactly-once RPC protocol on top of an asynchronous network, ensuring reliable communication between nodes</li>
<li>Enhanced the system with fault-tolerance capabilities through a primary-backup replication protocol</li>
<li>Implemented Paxos consensus algorithm to ensure strong consistency across replicas, allowing the system to handle node failures and network partitions gracefully</li>
<li>Built comprehensive test suites to verify system behavior under various failure scenarios and message ordering conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The project demonstrates practical implementation of distributed systems theory, focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling asynchronous network communication</li>
<li>Managing node failures and recovery</li>
<li>Implementing distributed consensus</li>
<li>Ensuring data consistency across replicas</li>
<li>Building fault-tolerant distributed services</li>

<p>This implementation served as a practical exploration of how production-grade distributed storage systems handle reliability and consistency challenges.</p>

                                    <p>Developed an innovative healthcare automation system combining robotics and IoT to assist medical staff in routine patient care tasks. The project integrated multiple technologies to create a comprehensive solution for patient monitoring and medication delivery. It is a line following robot, which successfully navigates across &lsquo;+&rsquo; junctions, performs a U-turn at the end and starts sensory activity when the finger is placed. The value is updated immediately on the Blynk app&rsquo;s displays, and then the robot automatically follows the same path back to the starting position.</p>
<h5 id="technical-components">Technical Components</h5>
<ul>
<li>Built a line-following robot using Arduino Uno with four IR sensors for hospital navigation</li>
<li>Integrated a 3-DOF robotic arm controlled by NodeMCU for medication transport</li>
<li>Implemented vital sign monitoring using MAX30105 (pulse) and MLX90614 (temperature) sensors</li>
<li>Developed mobile interface using Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control</li>
<li>Established UART and I2C communication between components</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="key-features">Key Features</h5>
<ul>
<li>Autonomous navigation through hospital wards</li>
<li>Real-time vital sign monitoring and data transmission</li>
<li>Remote control through mobile application</li>
<li>Automated medication delivery system</li>
<li>WiFi-enabled data transmission</li>
</ul>
<p>This project took us more time than expected, since I had no prior experience in working with Arduino, or building robots from scratch, and the other group members also were assigned unfamiliar tasks. But it was a very fruitful experience, especially in the end when we saw the whole bot perform end-to-end operations.</p>

						<p class="testimonial__text">I had Kaushik as an intern for over a year at Skima, where he was
							deeply
							involved in developing our product's functionalities. Despite juggling college commitments,
							he was
							regularly present, completing tasks on time, and handling on-the-spot assignments
							effectively. Over
							the year, Kaushik progressed from minimal technical experience to independently creating
							end-to-end
							features. Kaushik’s technical proficiency, work ethic, and positive attitude will surely
							make him a
							valuable addition to any organisation.</p>

						<p class="testimonial__title">Engineering@Skima</p>
						<p class="testimonial__date">July 1, 2024</p>
						<p class="testimonial__text">I worked closely with Kaushik during his year-long internship at
							Skima,
							where he quickly became key to our team.
							Kaushik balanced working alone and with others well. He handled backend tasks like
							developing our
							billing using the Stripe SDK, and the analytics dashboard using Elasticsearch and Sidekiq
							workers on
							his own, while also collaborating regularly with frontend, content, and testing teams to
							make sure
							everything worked together smoothly.
							He owned his work, keeping everyone updated about progress as well as challenges, without
							needing
							reminders. An important part of Kaushik's growth was learning to code with users in mind,
							which
							significantly improved his work quality. He demonstrated strong skills in Ruby on Rails,
							effectively
							utilizing ActiveRecord for database operations with PostgreSQL. His optimizations resulted
							in query
							speed improvements of up to 70%.
							I recommend Kaushik for any software development job. His technical skills, user-focused
							approach,
							and teamwork would make him valuable to any company..</p>
