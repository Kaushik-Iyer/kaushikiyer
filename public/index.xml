      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a personal project on which I worked at during summer 2024. Since a long time I had been wanting to develop a proper project from scratch which was not a youtube tutorial or a walkthrough. All of the ideas for this project were things that I wanted to implement. The whole backend and frontend has been done by myself, and since I like working on backend more, unfortunately the frontend aesthetics and accessibility are not upto the mark. Anyway, the frontend is in React, and backend built in python&amp;rsquo;s FASTAPI. The scores are regularly updated from a third party API through websockets, the nearby grounds are fetched by using the user&amp;rsquo;s location and Google Places API. The website also performs Google OAuth 2.0 through the frontend itself. A large part of the project also involved figuring out the hosting aspects, including getting a domain, and hosting the frontend as well as the backend folders. I eventually got a domain free for a year through name.com, hosted the frontend through cloudflare pages in their free tier, and got to host the backend in heroku for 2 years through Github&amp;rsquo;s Student Developer Pack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Built this group project as part of Cornell&amp;rsquo;s Applications of Parallel Computers course (CS 5220), where we tackled the classic Traveling Salesman Problem using various optimization techniques. The goal was to push the boundaries of what&amp;rsquo;s possible with parallel computing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We implemented four different approaches - from exact solutions using Brute Force and Dynamic Programming to heuristic methods like Greedy and Genetic algorithms. The real challenge was optimizing these for parallel execution using OpenMP and CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-education-accessible-through-technology&#34;&gt;Making Education Accessible Through Technology&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my role at Cornell University, I work to bridge the gap between traditional educational materials and accessible formats, ensuring that all students have equal access to learning resources:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transform complex textbooks and academic materials into accessible formats using advanced document processing techniques&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Utilize Microsoft Word&amp;rsquo;s advanced features to optimize document layouts, headers, footers, and references for various accessibility needs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate daily through Microsoft Teams to coordinate task assignments and ensure timely delivery of converted materials&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Work closely with disability services to understand and implement specific accessibility requirements for different learning needs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maintain detailed documentation of conversion processes and best practices&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Participate in regular training sessions to stay updated with the latest accessibility standards and tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This position has deepened my understanding of inclusive design principles and the critical role of technology in creating equitable educational experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GreenTech Registry on Blockchain</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/greentech-registry-on-blockchain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I developed this project during my first semester at Cornell, as a part of my M.Eng Project for the Systems Engineering faculty. This project aims to solve some of the shortcomings of existing greentech technologies such as lack of verifiability and difficulty in tracking orders by leveraging the strengths of blockchain technology and its features of immutability, verifiability, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And since this was a part of an academic research paper as well, extensive efforts were put into performance testing of the platform, which included performing load testing under multiple simultaneous users calling computationally intensive functionalities such as create project, and upload images. These tests were performed under different request body sizes and multiple such calls. The test suites and visualizations were custom developed in Python, primarily using modules such as asyncio, locust, and matplotlib for concurrency, load test configurations, and visualizations respectively. These were custom made because Postman&amp;rsquo;s collection run functionality did not cater to this particular use case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sample blog content. Like a lorem ipsum but saying something more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an unordered list sample 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an unordered list sample 2&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an unordered indented list sample 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an unordered indented list sample 2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an ordered list sample 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an ordered list sample 2&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an ordered indented list sample 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is an ordered indented list sample 2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of &amp;ldquo;Content Ipsum,&amp;rdquo; the fresh alternative to the classic lorem ipsum. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect blend for designers and writers who crave a dash of creativity and meaning in their placeholder text. Imagine a text that not only fills the space but also sparks the imagination, a text that weaves tales of innovation, inspiration, and the endless possibilities that creativity brings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/nursebot-healthcare-automation-system/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed an innovative healthcare automation system combining robotics and IoT to assist medical staff in routine patient care tasks. The project integrated multiple technologies to create a comprehensive solution for patient monitoring and medication delivery. It is a line following robot, which successfully navigates across &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; junctions, performs a U-turn at the end and starts sensory activity when the finger is placed. The value is updated immediately on the Blynk app&amp;rsquo;s displays, and then the robot automatically follows the same path back to the starting position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
