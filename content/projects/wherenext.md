A weekend project using Google Maps APIs to suggest places to visit. Select a country, continent, or randomize!

Note: Random results may include water bodies or remote locations.

Apart from geographical filters, you can also filter the places of interest:

- Museums             - Art Galleries
- Movie Theaters       - Parks
- Campgrounds          - Zoos
- Restaurants          - Cafes
- Bars                 - Shopping Malls
- Department Stores    - Casinos
- Night Clubs          - Amusement Parks
- Stadiums             - Churches
- Mosques              - Hindu Temples
- Synagogues

After a place is selected, a maximum of 4 spots nearby are shown, with a photo and a description of it. All of the data is pulled from google maps.
