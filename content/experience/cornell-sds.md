### Making Education Accessible Through Technology

In my role at Cornell University, I work to bridge the gap between traditional educational materials and accessible formats, ensuring that all students have equal access to learning resources:

- Transform complex textbooks and academic materials into accessible formats using advanced document processing techniques
- Utilize Microsoft Word's advanced features to optimize document layouts, headers, footers, and references for various accessibility needs
- Collaborate daily through Microsoft Teams to coordinate task assignments and ensure timely delivery of converted materials
- Work closely with disability services to understand and implement specific accessibility requirements for different learning needs
- Maintain detailed documentation of conversion processes and best practices
- Participate in regular training sessions to stay updated with the latest accessibility standards and tools

This position has deepened my understanding of inclusive design principles and the critical role of technology in creating equitable educational experiences.
