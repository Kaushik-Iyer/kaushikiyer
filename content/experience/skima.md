### Building the Future of AI-Powered Recruitment

My journey at Skima.ai was transformative, working at the intersection of recruitment technology and artificial intelligence. As one of the early engineering interns at this ambitious startup, I had the opportunity to work on critical infrastructure and performance optimization that directly impacted our user experience.

I spearheaded several key initiatives that significantly improved our platform's performance:

- Engineered a 70% improvement in query speed through sophisticated optimization of Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord with PostgreSQL, transforming our candidate listing pages from sluggish to near-instantaneous
- Architected and implemented an asynchronous processing system using Sidekiq workers and cron jobs, dramatically improving system responsiveness for our recruitment partners
- Led the migration of our critical workflow to AWS Lambda, achieving a 50% boost in processing speed and enabling real-time data-driven decision making
- Integrated and fine-tuned multiple third-party APIs including Stripe for payments and Greenhouse for ATS integration
- Developed robust web scraping solutions using Python and Selenium to expand our market analysis capabilities
- Implemented advanced LLM prompt engineering using OpenAI's Ruby gem, automating diverse data generation and enhancing our AI-powered features

Working in a fast-paced startup environment taught me invaluable lessons about rapid iteration, cross-functional collaboration, and the importance of building scalable solutions. Each feature release directly impacted our user acquisition and retention metrics, providing immediate feedback on our engineering decisions.
