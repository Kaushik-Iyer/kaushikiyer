- Participated in high-stakes investigations into stock market fraud, developing analytical skills and attention to detail
- Collaborated with senior investigators to analyze complex financial data patterns and identify potential fraudulent activities
- Gained practical experience with GitHub for version control and collaborative forensic tool development

This experience gave me valuable insights into the intersection of technology and financial security, teaching me the importance of precision and thoroughness in security-critical applications.
