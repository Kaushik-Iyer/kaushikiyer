I thought of making Where Next one random thursday night, and started working on it the next morning. This time, to counter the issue of deciding when does a personal project 'end', I told myself this would strictly be a weekend project. This helped a lot in properly finalizing the scope, difficulty and complexity of this project. Apart from some of the technical goals achieved while making this project, such as using the Places APIs, working with js and python, and most importantly setting up alerts and quotas for apis, the main goal that I achieved was to actually complete and wrap everything up by Monday, including hosting.
